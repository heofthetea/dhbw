>  Execution of the actual exploit within [[Metasploit Framework|MSF]]

- e.g. target a specific [[CVE]]

## Active Exploits
- exploits where I as the client (attacker) initiate an action

> [!hint] This is what I'll need for [[Metasploitable 2 Progress Track|Metasploitable 2]]

## Passive Exploits
- waits for incoming victims
	- e.g. [[Man-in-the-Middle Attack|MIMs]], sniffing or hosting a malicious website

# Utilization
- it's a [[MSF Module]] -> `use <exploit>`

> [!hint] This enables two commands:
> - `check` (checks whether the target is vulnerable)
> - `exploit` (perform an exploit attempt)

### Show targets
- shows the targets vulnerable to this [[Exploit]]

> [!warning] These are not actual machines on a network, but rather what needs to be present on a machine for the exploit to (potentially) work

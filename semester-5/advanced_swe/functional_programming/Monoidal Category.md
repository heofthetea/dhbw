[[Category]], [[Monoid]]

#todo actual definition with functors

- A [[Category]] that's also a [[Monoid]]:
	- $\Sigma$ is the [[Menge|Set]] of all [[Object|objects]]
	- $f$ is an Operation on Categories (e.g. a [[Product]] or a [[Coproduct]])
	- $0$ depends on $f$

## Example: Category of Sets respective to [[Product]]
- $\Sigma$ is the Set of all Sets (we deliberately ignore [[Russellsche Antinomie]] here)
- $f$ is the [[Product]] as defined by the universal construction
- $0$ is the [[Singleton Set]]

> An [[Umkehrfunktion|invertible]] [[Morphism]]

> [!hint] Or: A pair of Morphisms being inverse
> -> This is how you prove [[Isomorphism]]: Come up with two morphisms that are inverse of each other.

- Isomorphism forms a very weak form of Equality.

> [!hint] Is the same notion for [[Functor|functors]] -> Two Categories are isomorph if there exists an invertible morphism mapping one to the other.

- here, $f$ and $f^{-1}$ form an [[Isomorphism]].

## Definition: Unique up to unique Isomorphism
- Means two Objects are isomorph
- and: there's only _one_ Isomorphism connecting them.

 (or something idfk Isomorphisms seem to be very deep into Topology)

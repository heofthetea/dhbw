In a 2-element [[Abbildung|Function]] $f^{(2)}$, an element $0$ is a neutral element respective to $f$ iff:

$$f(0, a) = a$$

## Example

- $0$ is neutral in the set of [[Natürliche Zahlen|natural Numbers]] respective to Addition ($0 + 5  = 5$)
- $1$ is neutral in the set of [[Natürliche Zahlen|natural numbers]] respective to multiplication ($1 \cdot 5 = 5$)

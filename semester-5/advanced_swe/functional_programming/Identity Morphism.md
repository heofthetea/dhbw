> A [[Morphism]] mapping an [[Object]] $A$ to itself.

$$id_{A}$$

> [!info] The [[Object]] subscript is often discarded, as it is trivially reconstructed. Instead, The [[Identity Morphism]] is generalized as $id$ ([[Identity Morphism|Identity]]).

> [!hint] The [[Identity Morphism]] is the [[Neutrales Element|neutral Element]] of [[Composition]].
> - if $f: A \longrightarrow B$, then:
> 	- $f \circ id_{B} = f$
> 	- $id_{A} \circ f = f$
> - => **it follows**: $id_{A} \circ id_{A} = id_{A}$

> [!hint] The [[Identity Morphism]] is [[Isomorphism|isomorph]].

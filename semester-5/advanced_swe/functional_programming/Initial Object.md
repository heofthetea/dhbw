> The [[Object]] $i \in C$ with **exactly** one [[Morphism]] mapping $i$ to any other [[Object]] $o \in C$

> [!hint] Due to [[Composition]], mapping to any object will map to _all_ objects (as long as the category is a [[verbundener Graph|fully connected]], which I'm sure there is some definition somewhere)

## Examples
- The [[Unit]] in the [[Category]] of [[Menge|Sets]]
- [[Zero]] in the [[Natürliche Zahlen|natural numbers]]

Let's assume that by the theory of the Big Bang, the Universe is continuously expanding from a singular Point $O = \begin{bmatrix}0 \\ 0 \\ 0 \end{bmatrix}$. By the fact that the Universe is expanding must follow for every possible point $p$ within the Universe: $p \in P =\set{\begin{bmatrix}x_{1} \\ x_{2} \\ x_{3} \end{bmatrix} \in \mathbb{N}^{3}\ |\ 0 \leq |x| \leq r,\ r \in \mathbb{N}}$ 
We can use the natural Numbers $\mathbb{N}$ as our base for there is no infinitely small particle, meaning every $p$ can be identified using a small enough scale.

Since the Set $P$ is bounded and bases on $\mathbb{N}$, this means that $P$ must be finite.

Let's assume your consciousness to be defined by a true subset  of all particles, $C \subsetneq P$ .
Since the follwoing is true:
$$\forall_{S \subset P}(|P| \in \mathbb{N} \Rightarrow |S| \in \mathbb{N})$$
$|C| \in \mathbb{N}$ is also true and thus, that $C$ is finite.

Let's denote the time you are alive by a sequence $(t)_{n}: \mathbb{N} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ of infinitely small steps of time. As you will only live a finite amount of time, we know that $\lim\limits_{n \to \infty}(t)_{n} \in \mathbb{R}$. As your mood changes over time (reflected by a change in what we called $C$, we need to define all possible moods you will have as a relation $C_{n} \subset t_{n} \times P$. Your moment of scaredness thus can be defined by an index $s$.
$$C_{s} \in C_{n} \Rightarrow C_{s} = (t_{s}, C)$$ And is thus finite which I will not further elaborate on because this is way too stupid and long already

### Constraints
- [[NAT#Symmetric NAT|Symmetric NAT]]: NAS is not available from the outside
- DSM: fucking difficult to work with  because it can't just behave like a regular linux

## Solution
### 1. Use Cloudflare
- that allows for automated DNS-01 challenges 
- Generally better UI than hostinger lel

### 2. Blatantly steal someone's github gist
> [!warning] Beware that all scripts need to be ran as root - otherwise DSM complains becase it's stupid

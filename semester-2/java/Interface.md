- Can be understood as a **Role** of a [[Class]]
- one Class can implement multiple interfaces
- Defines only public Methods and [[final modifier|final]] constants.
	- (the `static final` modifier is put there automatically by the compiler)
- However: [[Default Implementation Interface]]

==> Can be used to deal with specific aspects of an [[Object]] without needing to take any extra information about that Object into account

## in Java
An [[Interface]] declares a set of Methods, a [[Class]] has to implement.

A [[Class]] implementing an [[Interface]] $i$ is type compatible with all other classes implementing $i$. ??

```java
interface IDevice {
	public Processor getProcessor(Processor proc);
}


class Macbook implements IDevice {
	public Processor getProcessor(Processor proc) {
		return M1;
	}
}
```

--> Arrow should be dotted lol

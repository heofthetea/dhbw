[[Class|Classes]] don't give enough structure
--> Group semantically connected classes into packages
- A package is equivalent to a directory on OS-level

- Example: A Package for Zip files, for I/O, etc...

A [[Class]] belongs to _exactly one_ Packag


### Default Package
Invoked, when a package is declared in the root directory of the project

### Packages when importing
> [!hint] All [[Class|classes]] from the same [[Java Package|package]] as the current class can be imported without an import!

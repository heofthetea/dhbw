### custom shot at formal definition
An [[Object]] is [[Tupel]] defined by two sets: the [[Menge|set]] of it's [[Attribut|Attributes]] $A$, and the set of it's [[Methode|methods]] $M$.
$$O = ({A}, {M})$$
where each [[Attribut]] is a key-value pair:
$$a = (k: v) \in A$$
and each [[Methode|method]] is a [[function]]: pi
$$m: X \longrightarrow Y$$

The [[Schema einer Relation|scheme]] $(A, M)$ is defined by the objects [[Class]], where the only thing differing among [[Object|objects]] of the same [[Class]] is it's values $v$.

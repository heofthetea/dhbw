> "Is-a" Relation: A Child [[Class]] is a _Specification_ of its Parent [[Class]].


A Child class inherits all Attributes and Methods from its Parent.
- [[Constructor|Constructors]] are not inherited !
	- instead: Call the parent constructor using [[Constructor Chaining]]

## Class hierarchy tree
[[Inheritance]] leads to classes being in a tree structure.
--> Each Cass has exactly _one_ Parent

> How _expensive_ is an Algorithm?

- how many steps does it need for a given input?
- How much space does it need?

### Criteria
- Performance based on _expected_ input data!
- Performance in [[Worst Case]]
- Demands of the Environment (Real-time? Space limited?)
- provable Correctness

> [!hint] Elegance and Simplicity are difficult to quantify, but nevertheless important!!

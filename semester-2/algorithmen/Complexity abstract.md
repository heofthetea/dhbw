### Issues
- Which operations? (addition is easier than exponentiation)
- Location of operands (Register, cache, RAM, swap)
- Length of operands (bitsize)
- Clock frequency of processor
- Programming Language / Compiler

#### more dependant on
- Processor model
- sice of cache and RAM
- Runtime factors (other processesd running in parallel?)

## abstracted
- Assignment needs **1 time unit** (ZE)
- an arithmetic operation needs **1 ZU**
- a comparison needs **1. ZE**

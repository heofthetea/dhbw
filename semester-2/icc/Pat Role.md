I'll pay within one month
### Fallback
- I'm authorized to pay 250000
[[BATNA]]: other lot for 265.000
--> North star: 200'000
initial offer: 140 (tax assessment) 
- C ist in gutem Zustand - der Abriss wäre schlimmer für Neighbourhood

## Emotional manipulation
- we know each other from high school - friendliness
- Begin with small talk about "Natalie" - tracy's classmate I married
- I have 4 kids - Little Johnny, Lilly, Franz and Bogo Sort 
	- need the space, but can't afford to pay a lot
## Speculation
- Question: Am I buying on behalf of someone else?
	- muss ehrlich sein
	- kauf für nen Freund
- Speak in subjunctive: "If I were to live in the house"
- Very low initial offer: 150.000 Consider necessary repairs

### MIT App Inventor
#### KO criteria
- runs on Linux, but setup might be a little complicated
- free + open source
#### further
- Block based --> no extra skills need to be learnt
- Integration with Google Firebase (could prove useful)

### Java Processing
#### KO criteria
- free + open source
- runs on any operating system
- comes with an IDE (but can be integrated to vs code), team development via git lol
- 'Processing for Android' mode can be installed

#### further
- Based on [[Hub Java|Java]]
- can be compiled to apk, but is not its primary functionality
- creating UIs is a pain (because you control the pixels on a low level)

### Eclipse
(welp I gotta do some research about this
- Android setup _can_ be setup, but doing so is (as almost everything eclipse-related) a pain in the ass

#### further
- AI not really intuitive by my standard - Lots of symbols which are not labelled
-

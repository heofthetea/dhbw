[[Superconducting Qubit]]


- [[Superconducting Qubit]]
	- advantage: high scalability (semiconductor fabrication), high designability
	- disadvantage: high noise, requires extreme environment
- Trapped Ions
	- can sustain ~50s without [[Decoherence]]
	- easy [[Quantum Entanglement|entanglement]]
	- disadvantage: slow af, difficult to scale
- Neutral Atoms
	- low error rates
	- good scalability
	- disadvantage: [[Qubit]] liftime is low, high sensitivity to noise

> [!question] How tf can QC help with drug discovery (and other medical fields)?


> [!question]- once that day comes - what type of qubit will be the built into general-public computers?
> probably [[Superconducting Qubit]] -> there is research into superconducting materials, that operate at room-temperature.

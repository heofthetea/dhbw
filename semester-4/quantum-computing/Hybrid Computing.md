> Combine Classical and [[Quantum Computer|Quantum]] Computing

- QC is only good for _some_ tasks
- potentially similar to how GPUs are included as an extension to [[Minimalsystem|minimal system]] for dedicated tasks

> [!hint] There is no possibility currently to **store** [[Qubit|Qubits]]
> Solution: Store Data traditionally, then create [[Qubit|Qubits]] as needed and calculate as quckly as possible.

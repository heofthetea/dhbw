> [!hint] [[Quantum Gates]] entangle two [[Qubit|Qubits]].

$$\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|00\rangle + |11\rangle)$$

is an example.

> [!warning] An entanglement only exists if every [[Qubit]] can be different - $\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} |00\rangle + \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}|01\rangle = |0\rangle + \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|1\rangle + |0\rangle)$ is not


### Entangled Photons
[[SPDC]] with a type 2 crystal
- pump photon: horizontal polarization
	- after the crystal: one is horizontal, the other vertically polarized

> [!info] These two are exactly complementary to each other!

- QC offers scaling improvements in the field of [[Komplexität|complexity theory]]:
	- Possibility to solve [[NP-Vollständigkeit|NP-complete]] problems in [[Polynomielle Laufzeit|polynomial time]].

> [!hint] In the Field of [[Machine Learning]], there's a hope for greater accuracy of Models, less training data... -> [[Quantum ML]]

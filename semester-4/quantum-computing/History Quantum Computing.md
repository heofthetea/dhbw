- Max Planck: has problems with interpretation - believes stuff is not discrete, but continuous
- a bunch of Noble prizes for Planck, Einstein & SchrÃ¶dinger (1918, 1921, 1923)
- Copenhagen's interpretation of quantum computing in 1925
- 1927: [[Transistor]]s use quantum physics (indirectly)
	- [[Laser|Lasers]] use quantum effects?? -> Used to create Transistors
- Second Quantum Revolution -> isolates one topic: atom/photon/different objects
	- a single [[Quantom Object]] can carry information, but the system is so small that it can carry only _one_ information
- Someone tried to build a Quantum [[Turing Machine]]
- 1994: Peter Shor finds solution to factorize large numbers - [[Shore's Algorithm]]
	- starting point of the contemporary discussion
- 1995: Dave Weinland first represents a two-[[Zustand|State]] system
	- Logical gate -> input 2 [[Qubit]]s, produce an Output
- Croover: [[Linear Search|Search]] on unsorted [[Liste|list]] in $\sqrt{n}$ time
- 2025: Willow has 105 of [[Qubit]]s
	- a lot of noise, Error correction not quite figured out

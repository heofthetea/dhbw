- [[Quantum Entanglement]]
- Idea: entangle two [[Qubit|qubits]] locally
	- then, if one is moved far away, a change to one will instantly change the state of the other


> [!warning] Measurements of particles are fundamentally random -> cannot be measured controllably

- Quantum Teleportation = transfer [[Superposition|Quantum States]], not actual particles
	- is not subject to influence of noise => quantum communication
- requires information, what required correction needs to be performed to the sent qubit -> requires classical information
	- is required because of the no-communication theory?
	- correction is based on the original message?

## Widerspruch
- if Earth sends a message to STL, and STL responds in faster than light:
	- response arrives before the message is sent
- WHY FUCKING HOW why would that arrive earlier??

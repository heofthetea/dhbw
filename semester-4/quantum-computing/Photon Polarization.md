## Polarized Beam splitter
- send a photon in
- splits beam in only vertical, and only horizontal waves

- send in beam at 45 degree vertical/horizontal
- with enough observations, 50% of the time it will be vertical, 50% will be horizontal
=> reduce this problem to a _single_ photon (using [[SPDC]])

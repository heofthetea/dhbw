[[Quantum Computing Workflow]]

- still very [[Hierarchie von Sprachen|low-level]] - on the Level of [[Qubit|Qubits]]
- [[Quantum Gates]]
- [[Quantum Circuit Model]]

> [!hint] A [[Quantum Computer]] is not actually necessary for quantum programming - it is essentially [[Master Lineare Algebra|Linear Algebra]] and can be simulated by Classical Computers. Limit is $\approx$ 25 [[Qubit|Qubits]].

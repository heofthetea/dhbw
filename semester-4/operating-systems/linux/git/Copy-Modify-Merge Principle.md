- File is in a central remote location
- Each developer has a _local_ copy of the remote file
- Changes to local copies are _committed_ to the central remote.
- Whenever changes are made to the remote file, each developer has to update their local copies.

> [!hint] Counter model: [[Lock-Modify-Unlock Principle]]
> The remote file gets locked whenever someone is editing it, and cannot be edited by anyone else, until the lock is released.

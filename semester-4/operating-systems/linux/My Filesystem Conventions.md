### 1. Necessary directories
```bash
mkdir -p \
	~/.local/bin \
	~/Repos
```
- throw source code for applications (or really anything I did not make myself) int `~/Repos`
- throw all stuff for _development_ into `~/Documents/Development`

Alright I just made a bunch of stuff unneccessary by discovering the `/usr/local/bin` directory --> Just throw all the application binaries in there aaaaaaa

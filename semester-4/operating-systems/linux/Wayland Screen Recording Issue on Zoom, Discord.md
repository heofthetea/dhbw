## Zoom
Zoom has a setting to force it which screen capture software to use. To find it in the _Zoom Settings_
- Share Screen
	- Advanced
		- change "Screen capture" from _auto mode_ to _pipewire mode_

> [!hint] Pipewire is some wayland software that... does something. Fun Fact: Discord 


### on iPadOS
That shit's not on me. I don't know who exactly messed what up in what configuration, but when _I_ host a meeting, everything works exactly as you would expect it to. The option to share the entire screen shows up just as it should, and when it does, it actually shares the screen as it is supposed to. Zoom is bullshit.

## Discord
Yeah, well... as one forum post reads: "Discord does not implement video capture via pipewire yet." Geil. 
Solution 1: When planning to share any screen via discord: Simply log out and back in with an Xorg Session.

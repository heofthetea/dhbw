This vault is supposed to help me journal and keep track of tools and Bugs I'll face in my working life at intension. The reason for this spawning into existence is that after my first theoretical phase ([DHBW Semester 1](obsidian://vault/DHBW/'Master Semester 1')), I more or less had forgotten most of the small technical details of my work.

Ideally, this will end up being a secondary database that not only _I_ will benefit from when looking things up in the future, but also may be passed on to later students.

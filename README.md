# DHBW Vault
An [Obsidian.md](https://obsidian.md/) vault where I keep my notes for my Computer Science Degree.

## Structure
The vault is structured in the following way:
- The filenames follow the structure of `<Role> <Module> Topic`. If the topic is a common acronym, the name is said acronym and not the expanded word.
- `Master` nodes: Used (after Semester 1) exclusively as an Entrypoint to semesters. `Master` Nodes only store references to Hubs.
- `Hub` nodes: Central nodes for a certain topic (typically one entire module). Contain references to (almost) all nodes relevant to their topic/module.
- `Library` nodes: These are summaries of certain topics. They try to link to as many notes as possible, but briefly explain those as well. **Use them as an entrypoint for finding a specific topic if you're new to the vault.**
	- **NOTE** that libraries are a construct of Semester 1. In Semester 3 I kind of abandoned them, save for `Formale Sprachen` and `Rechnerarchitekturen`, and instead relied on Hubs.

### Projects
Over the course of the degree, some coding projects pop up. Those are stored in their own repos:
1. [Ubiquitous Fishstick](https://github.com/TeeMitHonig/ubiquitous-fishstick) (Projektmanagement, Sem. 2)
2. [Geo Calc](https://github.com/heofthetea/DHBW-Geo-Calc) (Web-Engineering Sem. 2)
3. [DHBW Project Java](https://github.com/heofthetea/dhbw-project-java) (self-explanatory, Sem. 2)
## Misc
### Language
By far the majority of the vault is in german, as that's what the lectures are in. In programming-related lectures, I tried to keep the notes in english.

### Hand-written Notes
For Maths, and most of the stuff in Semester 1, I keep goodnotes files around. Those can be found in a google drive:

In pretty much every case I use this only for exam practice. If I find myself needing hand-write something for the contents of a note, those will be screenshotted and inserted into a note as an image.
